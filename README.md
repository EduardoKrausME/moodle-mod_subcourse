Subcourse module for Moodle
===========================

This Moodle module provides very simple yet useful functionality. When added into a
course, it behaves as a graded activity. The grade for each student is took from a
final grade in another course. Combined with
[metacourses](http://docs.moodle.org/en/Course_meta_link), this allows course
designers to effectively organise courses into separate units.

Usage
-----

* Create a main course and one or few other courses that should act as a sub-courses of
  the main course.
* Into the main course, add a new instance of the Subcourse activity module for each
  of the referenced course (sub-course) to fetch grades from.
* Enrol students into all courses (the main one as well as the referenced ones).
* Let students receive the final grades in the referenced courses.
* Check that the final grade in the referenced courses now appears as the grade for
  the Subcourse activity in the main course.
